# predicting-car-price-based-on-number-plate
It is a supervised learning task, since we are given labeled training examples (each instance comes with the expected output, i.e., the car price).

It is also a regression task, since we are asked to predict a value. More specifically, this is a multiple regression problem, since the system will use multiple features to make a prediction (it will use the id, plate, date.). It is also a univariate regression problem, since we are only trying to predict a single value for each instance.
